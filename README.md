# About this project

This is a small project demonstrating encapsulated CSS and the use of the styled-components library.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and follow the instructions below

### `npm start`

Run npm install, then npm start to run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser if it doesn't open automatically.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### Have a play

There are two sets of button components (they don't do anything); the normal button component and the styled button component, both providing examples of encapsulation.

The styled components are commented out. Uncomment them to see how they appear on the page.

Try passing different props, the ones that the components expect and ones they don't and see what happens.
